# Intent and ni economics
ni translates user intent into an executable strategy, which is a
fixed-allocation problem (ni assumes that margin trading is off the table).
Doing this involves modeling the user's goals as a linear quantity, which it
does by measuring _win_. ni maximizes elasticity-adjusted future win.

**TODO:** Formalize "one win = one linearized beer," but in a more Maslow-aware
way.
