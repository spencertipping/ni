# Intent and ni economics
ni can make cost-informed decisions like using metered connections or
allocating scarce resources. It does this by constructing a value function
centered around _intent_, which roughly translates to cost-adjusted utility for
the user. Intent is treated as a formal quantity and obeys laws of conservation
and additivity.

## Formal definitions
- one "intent" = one second of the user's focused attention

**TODO:** Think about this some more. It isn't clear that _focus_ == _value_.
