# Intent and ni economics
ni can make cost-informed decisions like using metered connections or
allocating scarce resources. It does this by constructing a value function
centered around _intent_, which roughly translates to cost-adjusted utility for
the user. Intent is treated as a formal quantity and obeys laws of conservation
and additivity.

As a unit of measure "one intent" is one second of user focus.
