# Intent and ni economics
ni operates within a fairly open-ended space; it can move computation between
machines, distribute things, and is aware of economic forces like resource
scarcity and metered connections. Its goal is to minimize the cost associated
with executing the thing you've asked it to do.

## Measuring cost
ni's unit of value is _win_, which is linear and has a context-specific
exchange rate to real-world currency like USD. Implied with your commands is
the win conferred by succeeding; ni is then required to either find a solution
that is a net win, or inform you that no such solution exists.

**TODO:** what is an even vaguely plausible definition for one win?
